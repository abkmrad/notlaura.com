# notlaura.com, [Timber](https://github.com/jarednova/timber) style.

Created from my [Timber Starter kit](https://github.com/laras126/timber-starter-kit). Which will hopefully turn into a starter theme with this ACF blocks system.

## A few things

(more here soon)

#### Content Blocks

In views/blocks - this is a content strategy I'm working on where all aspects of the CMS are essentially "content agnostic" (apart from one or two places).

#### Separation of Concerns

Content and presentation are separate. There should be no formatting and styling within the CMS, all is prepared to work together.

#### Sass Structure

Mimics the templates in views/ for the most part. The main components are:

* Site - all global elements.
* Page - styles relating to page layout, obvy.
* Blocks - styles for individual chunks of content used to build a page (these would be "molecules" in Atomic Design terms)
