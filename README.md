#notlaura.com redo
Largely inspired by [Destroy Today on Github](https://github.com/destroytoday/destroytoday.com#rules). That guy, [Jonnie Hallman](http://destroytoday.com), put his personal site up here and kept a nice list of rules for whenever it is updated.

The redesign of my personal site, [notlaura.com](http://notlaura.com) (even though I still like how it looks). Similar to the above link, I'll outline some goals/todos/guidelines for the design/dev process:

##Overall guides

###Dev
* WordPress
* Sass for styles
* Minimal plugins, use jQuery plugins over WP when possible

###Design/UX
* Large and readable typography
* Section out content areas with different colored backgrounds (like at (http://happycog.com/[Happy Cog])

###Content
* About (kind of a long scroll)
	* Picture
	* Catchy copy
	* Description of services
	* 
* Work
* Blog
* Contact


##Some Nitty Gritty

###Plugins/Tools
* [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting (I think)
* [Toggle nav](codepen.io/bradfrost/pen/sHvaz)


###Sass
* Keep all colors, fonts, and sizes in variables
*
