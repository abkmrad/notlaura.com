The redesign of my personal site, (http://notlaura.com)[notlaura.com] (even though I still like how it looks). Similar to the above link, I'll outline some goals/todos/guidelines for the design/dev process:

WordPress

##Design Outlines
Emphasis on typography
Section out content areas with different colored backgrounds (like here)
