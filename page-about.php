                                <p class="summary">I am a freelance web designer, developer, and instructor based in <strong>Brooklyn, NY</strong>. I'd love to make a website for you, but I'd also love to make it <em>with</em> you.</p>
                                
                                <h3>What can I do?</h3>

                                <p>I work extensively in <strong>custom WordPress development</strong> and <strong>front-end design</strong> for web applications. I provide private and small group instruction and consultation, as well as graphic design and branding services.</p>

                                <p>I believe in the importance of <strong>the mobile web</strong>, clean and <strong>semantic code</strong>, and do my best to utlilize upcoming web technologies while continuing to support web standards.</p>

                                <h3>Experience</h3>
                                                                
                                <p>In addition to my work with individual clients, I currently teach <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development/new-york-city" target="blank"><strong>Front-end Web Development</strong></a> at <strong>General Assembly</strong> in NYC. Past teaching endeavors include:</p>

                                <h3>Teaching philosophy</h3>
                                
                                <p>As much as I love building websites, I equally love sharing what I know. I've got a few strong-held values in my teaching:</p>
                                
                                <div>

                                    <h5>Learn what you <strong>need to know</strong></h5>
                                    <p>It's impossible to learn <em>every</em> nuance of a technology. I believe it is most effective to learn new skills as you need them, not because you think you should know them.</p>

                                    <h5>Learn to <strong>teach yourself</strong></h5>
                                    <p>My ultimate goal in teaching is for you to leave with the ability to continue learning, and to approach challenges with the mindset <em>"..if I don't know how to do this, I can figure it out."</em></p>

                                    <h5><strong>Confusion</strong> is the goal</h5>
                                    <p>To truly internalize a concept, you need experience and break through the many frustrating moments of confusion on your own. My goal to set up those moments for you, and provide guidance along the way.</p>
                                
                                </div>

                                <h3>More About Me</h3>

                                <p>In addition to all things web, I am passionate about games and learning. I work part-time as a Design Assistant for the <a href="http://instituteofplay.org" target="blank"><strong>Institute of Play</strong></a> at Quest to Learn, a public middle/high school that is reinventing education through game-like learning. At some point I plan to go back to school for instructional design or a similar field - still figuring that one out.</p>

                                <p>Finally, my background is in Fine Arts. I spent my first two years of college studying Printmaking at the University of Colorado at Boulder and finished up at Tufts Universityâ€™s School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston (SMFA) and received my <strong>B.F.A.</strong> in 2011.</p>
                                

                                <h3>Let's talk</h3>
                                <p>Finally, I love coffee and I love meeting people. Whether or not you have a project in mind, feel free to get in touch - I'd love to hear from you.</p>
