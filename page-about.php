                                <p class="lead">I am a freelance <strong>teacher</strong>, designer, and developer based in <strong>New York City</strong>. I'd love to make a website for you, but I'd rather make it <em>with</em> you.</p>

                                <h3>What's with the fishing?</h3>
                                
                                <p><strong>I love teaching</strong>, and I firmly believe that the best way to learn is either 1-on-1 or in a small group. Larger classes can be great, but the variation in ability among students can hamper the experience for everyone (including your teacher!).</p>

                                <p>Working with me is different. During our sessions you will not be listening to me read through slides, and you will not be memorizing HTML tags. Instead, we will code side-by-side, learning the architecture of problem solving and workflow - the stuff that isn't so easy to get from tutorials.</p>

                                <p>That's what I mean by fishing.</p>

                                <h5>Education</h5>
                                <p>My background is in Fine Arts. I spent my first two years of college studying Printmaking at the University of Colorado at Boulder and finished up at <strong>Tufts University</strong>â€™s School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston (SMFA) and received my <strong>B.F.A.</strong> in 2011.</p>
