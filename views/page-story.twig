				<p class="highlight">Front-end Web Developer</p>
				<p>I absolutely love writing Sass, component-izing markup, and staying on top of the latest and greatest. CSS Grid Layout 💜, SVG animation, and accessibility are a few things I'm especially jazzed about these days. In general, I'm on the UX side of things.</p>
				<p>But let's also mention...</p>
				<p class="highlight">JavaScript</p>
				<p>I am on a personal and professional mission to learn JavaScript and to learn it deeply. And I'm making progress! I built this whole interactive thing <em>without</em> jQuery, gosh-darnit.</p>

				<p class="panel-indicator">Non-Techie</p>
				<h2 class="panel-title">I build websites!</h2>
				<p class="lead">More specifically, a "Front-end Web Developer". Let me explain.</p>
				<p>A front-end developer is someone who specializes in developing (and sometimes designing) <em>what you see</em> on a web page, rather than the logic, data, and algorithms that power the functionality of a website, a.k.a. the back-end.</p>
				<p>For example, if I was the front-end developer helping to build Google.com, I would be in charge of placing the search box on the appropriate part of the page, adding a box shadow to it, and creating a nice, satisfying to click button. Making the search button actually work &dash; that's the role of a back-end developer.</p>
