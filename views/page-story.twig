				<p class="lead">Our job titles are lacking, don't you think? These days, I call myself a UX Developer.</p>
				<p>In other words, I'm a front-end developer on the UX side of things. I absolutely love writing Sass, component-izing markup, and staying on top of the latest and greatest. CSS Grid Layout 💜, SVG animation, and accessibility are a few things I'm especially jazzed about these days. I love designing and coding at the same time.</p>
				<p>Let's also mention...<strong>JavaScript 😱</strong>.</p>
				<p>I am on a personal and professional mission to learn JavaScript deeply. I'm making progress; I built this whole interactive thing <em>without</em> jQuery (mostly), gosh-darnit.</p>

				<h2 class="panel-title">I build websites!</h2>
				<p class="lead">More specifically, the "front-end" of websites.</p>
				<p>The front-end of a website is <em>what you see</em> on a web page, rather than the logic, databases, and algorithms that power the functionality of a website, a.k.a. the back-end.</p>
				<p>For example, if I was the front-end developer helping to build Google.com, I would be in charge of placing the search box on the appropriate part of the page, adding a box shadow to it, and creating a nice, satisfying to click button. Making the search button actually do a search &dash; that's the role of a back-end developer.</p>
